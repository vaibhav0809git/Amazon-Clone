# project

#This project is a basic static clone of Amazon's e-commerce platform, built using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the design of key Amazon pages, including the home page, product listings, and product detail pages. The project focuses on front-end development, showcasing the layout, structure, and styling without dynamic functionality (JavaScript or backend integration).

#Home Page: A landing page featuring a header with navigation, a product showcase, and a footer.

#Product Listing Page: Displays various products in a grid format, styled using responsive CSS techniques.

#Product Detail Page: Provides a product image, description, and "Add to Cart" button (non-functional).

#Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

#Navigation Bar: A header with links to different sections, including the logo, search bar, and user account/cart placeholders.
